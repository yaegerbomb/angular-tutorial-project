# Basic AngularJS Application

## About
A basic project example of using the AngularJS framework that I will use as a starting point for my brief AngularJS tutorial. This application contains an example of at least one componenent, constant, controller, directive, factory, filter, route, service, template, and view file. The backend is faked by using [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) as the API. The code here tries to follow John Papa's styleguide which can be found here: [https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1).

The project is using Bootstrap as the UI framework along with Bootstrap's JavaScript modules. Angular applications do not require Bootstrap to work and is only in here for quick UI developement purposes. Bootsrap and JQuery could be removed and the application will still work.

## Setup
* clone the project
* run `npm install`
* run `node server.js`
